"""review/style.py — the review_tips config seam (SR-LR-1, section 5L.6).

SEAM CONTRACT
  ``get_review_tips(config=None)`` is the call-point for the review DAG nodes'
  spec/prompt.  The shipped default is Ada's retrieval-grounded section 5L.6 prose:
  the saturation loop, counter-position/L-2 gate, and disconfirming obligation, each
  anchored to the systematic-review methodology it operationalizes (protocol
  pre-registration, both-direction snowballing, saturation-as-plateau, concept-centric
  synthesis).  Adopters override per lab/venue via the ``[review_style]`` section in
  ``research_vault.toml``.  Method anchors named in the prose are attributed in the
  framework's ``REFERENCES.md``.

  Shape:
    review_tips = {
        "review_scope_tips":      "<str>",
        "review_search_tips":     "<str>",
        "review_snowball_tips":   "<str>",
        "per_paper_relate_tips":  "<str>",
        "review_synthesize_tips": "<str>",
        "review_critic_tips":     "<str>",
    }

  Every key must be present in the returned dict (adopter overrides may replace
  individual values but the key set is fixed).  ``get_review_tips`` merges the
  adopter's ``[review_style]`` section over the default so adopters only need to
  specify the keys they want to change.

  ``get_review_style_preamble(config=None)`` returns the preamble injected before
  every node spec string — adopted via ``[review_style] preamble = "..."`` in
  ``research_vault.toml``.

Two halves independently mergeable:
  - Engineer ships this module (SR-LR-1 plumbing).
  - Ada owns the default payload — the retrieval-grounded section 5L.6 strings.
  Keep ``get_review_tips`` / ``get_review_style_preamble`` signatures stable.

Stdlib only.
