## 2026-07-01 (SR-4 reviewer fixes — B1/F1/F2)

### Done
- B1: pushed unpushed commit 41a3a16 (Stanford identity marker class, +2 scanner lines, +2 tests)
  together with F1+F2 below.
- F1: added 2 missing leakage-gate marker classes per SR-4 spec §5 scope-IN:
  - Class 8 (real citekeys): Pandoc `[@key]` citation format — detects private bibliography
    references; pattern `\[@[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_:-]+`. 3 new tests.
  - Class 9 (real projects.json entries): `"_hub"` infrastructure slug + `"code": "dsr"` dossier
    registry code (not covered by Class 1 codename scanner). 3 new tests.
  Scanner now 9 classes; test suite 35 leakage tests (260+6=266 total). All green.
  Doctrine/ GREEN on new classes (Argus-confirmed no residue).
- F2: `git rm --cached doctrine/drift-watch.md` + added to .gitignore. File stays on disk as a
  local-only maintenance aid. DEVLOG references are historical (no link in docs/manifest/rv help).

### Decisions
- Class 8 pattern: `\[@[A-Za-z]` captures ALL Pandoc citations (any inline `[@word` is a private
  citekey — doctrine must not cite the private bibliography).
- Class 9 patterns: `"_hub"` (hub infrastructure slug) + `"code": "dsr"` (dossier project code)
  are the two projects.json entries NOT already caught by Class 1 codename scan.
- drift-watch.md kept local: it maps `~/vault/src/content/docs/method/` paths and Astro/Starlight
  layout — private vault structure. Operator call correct: keep as local-only re-sync aid, not
  committed to the soon-to-be-public repo.

### Open / next
- PR #4 still awaiting operator go after re-review (CI must be green before go).

## 2026-06-30 (SR-4)

### Done
- SR-4: full spine landed in PR #4 (feat/sr-4-spine).
- Leakage scanner: scripts/leakage_scan.sh upgraded from skeleton to full teeth — 7 marker
  classes, 27 hermetic tests (each RED on planted marker, GREEN on scrubbed content). CI now
  calls the script (replaces inline stub). Caught drift-watch.md self-referencing cluster paths
  before commit — good proof the gate is live.
- Agent charter, 6 portable doctrine disciplines (note-conventions, standards, review-board,
  coordination, memory-management), 7 role docs (Alfred/Wren/Atlas/Mason/Argus/Iris/Ada),
  drift-watch note — 15 commits, each preceded by a clean leakage scan.
- Scrub applied uniformly: identity strings, codenames, site URL, cluster paths, vault→rv CLI,
  private design themes, versioned model IDs stripped. Abstract policy (Sonnet/Opus/Haiku) kept.
- 258 tests passing. human-go gate: awaiting reviewer + architect + operator.

### Decisions
- Committed incrementally (one doc per commit) per the SR-4 brief — if session died, committed
  docs would survive. Session did not die; all 15 commits landed.
- Alfred (hub) role doc synthesized from charter + coordination + how-it-works (no standalone
  vault source exists) — flagged in PR review focus for close read.
- "sage seat" in reviewer doc scrubbed to "coordinator seat" — private identity for a specific
  GitHub token; the concept (coordinators post via a separate seat) is preserved.

### Open / next
- PR #4 awaiting: rv-reviewer verdict + rv-architect fit-check + operator go.

## 2026-06-30 (fix-round)

### Done
- BLOCKER 1: moved `project` positional to top-level verb parser for all 4 verbs (task, note,
  control, devlog) — documented form `rv task <project> <subcommand>` now works. All CLI tests
  updated to project-first form; new test exercises the documented form (was never tested).
- BLOCKER 2: fixed `_default_config()` to use relative sub-paths ("notes", "tasks", etc.)
  instead of cwd-absolute paths — `_expand_paths()` now resolves them against instance_root,
  so a config with only `instance_root` set correctly derives all paths from it.
  New test: minimal config (instance_root only) asserts all derived paths are under instance_root.
- BLOCKER 3: replaced a bare principal name with "owner" in the control.py template
  (docstring, _render_control_file, cmd_inbox fallback) and in control/acme.md. Added
  the corresponding word-boundary marker (case-insensitive) to the CI leakage scanner
  so this class of leak can't slip through again.
- 72 tests passing (was 70), rv help --check OK, leakage grep clean.

### Decisions
- Used "owner" (not "<owner>" or "the principal") in control template — clean, short, generic.
- Relative defaults in _default_config() rather than a sentinel/None approach — simpler, and
  _expand_paths() already had the relative-path resolution logic.

### Open / next
- PR #1 (feat/sr-1-scaffold) ready for re-review by rv-reviewer + rv-architect fit-check.

## 2026-06-30

### Done
- SR-1 scaffold: standalone package skeleton, config plane, CLI dispatcher, first 4 portable verbs
  (task, note, control, devlog), `rv help --check`, CI skeleton, tests.
- Package: `research_vault` / CLI verb `rv`, uv-managed, Python 3.12, pytest hermetic suite.
- Config plane: multi-project registry SSOT in `config.py` — zero hardcoded paths, zero codenames.
- Verbs are project-scoped: `rv task <project> …`, `control/<project>.md`, etc.

### Decisions
- Config SSOT: `research_vault.toml` (TOML, instance-local) with env-override escape hatch
  (`RESEARCH_VAULT_CONFIG`). Multi-project registry mirrors the live projects.json shape.
- Verbs re-implemented fresh from behavioral spec — no byte-for-byte copy of ~/vault code.
- `rv help --check` greens only when every registered verb has a `when_to_use` docstring.
- Leakage-scanner CI job: skeleton in place (grep for private markers); teeth land at SR-4.

### Open / next
- SR-2: remaining verbs (research, cite, role, build-agents, mdstore, wt, git-health, lint,
  wait-for) + adapter Protocols (Notifier, ComputeBackend, SecretStore) + plugin seam.
- ZERO ~/vault edits confirmed: all build + test work happened inside ~/research-vault.
